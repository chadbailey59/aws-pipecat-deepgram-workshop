# AWS/Pipecat/Deepgram Webinar and Workshop Studio Content

Let's use this repo to organize the work we're doing for the Voice AI Workshop Studio, and the AWS/Pipecat/Deepgram Webinar.

I've put Markdown versions of all of the Workshop Studio pages in the `workshop-studio` folder. I started by committing the existing reverse-markdownified content. Then, I've created a branch called `cb/workshop-update` and an associated pull request that shows all the changes I made to the content. It's not as bad as it looks. :)

I also moved the solutions files to `code/lab-solution-files`. That code (and hopefully, all the code in the workshop content) has been updated to use the latest Pipecat best practices.
