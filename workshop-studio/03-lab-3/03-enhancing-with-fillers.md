# Enhancing the voice agent by adding fillers

Now that we've implemented our voice agent using both direct and cascaded approaches, let's enhance it with additional capabilities to improve the user experience. One key area for improvement is managing user expectations during processing delays.

## Managing user expectations with TTS fillers

When our voice agent needs to perform time-consuming operations like retrieving information or processing complex queries, users may experience uncomfortable silence. To improve the experience, we can implement TTS fillers - brief verbal acknowledgments that let users know the system is working.

TTS fillers serve several important purposes:

1. **Reduce perceived wait time**: Users perceive shorter wait times when they receive feedback
2. **Maintain engagement**: Prevent users from thinking the system has crashed or stopped working
3. **Set expectations**: Let users know that a response is coming but might take a moment
4. **Humanize the interaction**: Make the conversation feel more natural and less robotic
