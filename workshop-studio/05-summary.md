# Summary

Congratulations on completing the "Building Intelligent Voice AI Agents with Amazon Nova Sonic, Amazon Bedrock and Pipecat" workshop! Let's review what we've learned.

## What we've built

Throughout this workshop, we've built a health assistant voice AI agent.

#### Lab 1: Building a basic voice AI agent with Amazon Nova Sonic

We explored direct speech-to-speech processing using Amazon Nova Sonic and implemented a basic voice AI agent with Pipecat. The lab demonstrated how to set up the foundation for voice interactions, understand the architecture components, and integrate function calling capabilities.

#### Lab 2: Adding core capabilities

We enhanced our health assistant with essential capabilities including knowledge retrieval, handling off-topic conversations, emergency detection and redirect, and integration with AWS Location Service. This lab focused on making the agent more useful, robust, and safety-conscious.

#### Lab 3: Exploring advanced capabilities

We implemented sophisticated features including cascaded models approach and TTS fillers for more natural conversations. This lab demonstrated how to create more personalized experiences and handle complex scenarios effectively.
