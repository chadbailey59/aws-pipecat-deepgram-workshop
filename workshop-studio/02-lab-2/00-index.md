# Lab 2: Adding agentic capabilities

In this lab, we'll use an example scenario of a health assistant voice agent with agentic capabilities that make it more useful and robust:

- Knowledge retrieval (using web search as an example)
- Handling off-topic conversations
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with a Strands agent

These capabilities will allow our agent to provide more accurate information, maintain focus on health-related topics, handle critical situations appropriately, and leverage external services through MCP.

Let's start by implementing knowledge retrieval capabilities.
